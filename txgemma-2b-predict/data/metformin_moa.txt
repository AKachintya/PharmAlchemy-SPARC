Title: Metformin's Mechanism of Action via AMPK Activation and mTOR Inhibition

Abstract: Metformin is a widely prescribed biguanide drug for the management of type 2 diabetes. Its primary molecular mechanism involves the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Activation of AMPK by metformin occurs indirectly, primarily through the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. This leads to a decrease in cellular ATP levels and a corresponding increase in the AMP:ATP ratio, which allosterically activates AMPK.

Once activated, AMPK initiates a cascade of downstream effects aimed at restoring energy balance. A key target of AMPK is the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, which is a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and protein synthesis. AMPK inhibits the mTOR pathway through at least two mechanisms: direct phosphorylation and inhibition of the mTORC1 complex component Raptor, and phosphorylation and activation of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), a negative regulator of mTOR. By inhibiting the mTOR pathway, metformin effectively reduces cellular proliferation and protein synthesis, a mechanism that is under active investigation for its potential anti-cancer properties.
